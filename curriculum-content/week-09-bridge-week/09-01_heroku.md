# Heroku

See [docs for deploying to Heroku](/resources/heroku.md).

You may have already deployed a Node.js app to Heroku. This week you will also need to:

- [Deploy a postgres database with Render.com](/resources/render_db.md)
- [Connect your heroku app to the Render.com database](/resources/render_db.md#connect-to-your-database-from-heroku).
