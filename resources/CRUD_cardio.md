# CRUD App Cardio
Here's a repository to *use as a template* for making new CRUD apps:

The best way for all of these new things to sink into your beautiful brains is *repitition*. When I did my bootcamp in 2017, one of the best tips I got on how to level-up my skills was to just keep making basic CRUD apps.

Here's a screenshot of a lil' CRUD app:

How long would it take you to make that exact thing, but how about snacks instead of creatures? Let's say four hours?

How long would it then take you to make that exact thing, but how about tools instead of snacks? Maybe three-and-a-half hours this time?

Hey, how long would it then take you make that exact thing, but how about shoes instead of tools? Maybe three hours this time?

You see where this is going.

The idea here isn't to make a series of beautiful things. This is more like a CRUD workout. The more simple CRUD apps you make, the more fluent you'll be with all of the new stuff you've learned up until now.

And once you've made a bunch of simple CRUD apps, maybe the next step is deciding to add one *cool new thing* into the next CRUD app you make. Maybe a CSS thing? Maybe some way to incorporate complex logic?

The idea here is reps!
